Developer Guide

This program uses GNU autoconf/automake.

To regenerate configuration scripts, do this:

aclocal ; autoconf ; automake -a

then configure with

./configure

to regenerate the Makefile's.

To create a package, use the command
make dist

MinGW / MSYS specific instructions:
In order to build under MinGW/MSYS, use commands like the following:
First, use the three commands listed above on a Linux machine to
generate an "configure" script, or download a prepackaged
neuroserver distribution.

./configure
then go into src/
cd src/
make -f Makefile.mingw
If this builds fine then you can try the sampleClient
cd ../sampleclient
make -f Makefile.mingw

Note that these Makefile's assume you have the following installed:
MinGW
MSYS
Dropline GTK binaries in default install location: C:/Dev-C++/
