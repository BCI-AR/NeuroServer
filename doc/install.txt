In order to compile the sample client, you may need to
install packages related to GTK 2.0 (sometimes called 1.3).
Under Suse 8.3, the necessary packages are called

gtk-2.0
glib-2.0
pango-1.0
pkg-config
atk-1.0

To install is easy:

./configure
make

This should create the executable src/neurod

If you would like the executable to be installed somewhere, just do
make install

In order to start it, simply invoke the

neurod

command from a shell or startup script.
