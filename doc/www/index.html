An open-source multi-platform EEG signal transceiver using TCP/IP and
EDF format.
<H3>Requirements:</H3>
For Windows users, just download the self-extracting binary available here:
<a href="NeuroServer-0.7.4-win.exe">NeuroServer-0.7.4-win.exe</a>


Linux users can download the source archive:
<a href="NeuroServer-0.7.4.tar.gz">NeuroServer-0.7.4.tar.gz</a>
To build, type
<pre>
./configure
make
make install
</pre>
To start, first turn on your ModEEG.  Then, start
<pre>
NSD
</pre>
which can be run from command-line or from your menu option:
<pre>
Start Menu | Programs | NeuroServer | NSD 
</pre>
NSD is the NeuroServer Daemon that must be running to enable network access.
The next step is to start the hardware driver:
<pre>
modeegdriver
</pre>
If your ModEEG is not connected to <b>COM1:</b>, then use the <b>-d</b> syntax:
<pre>
modeegdriver -d COM2
</pre>
This is also available in
<pre>
Start Menu | Programs | NeuroServer | MODEEGDRIVER 
</pre>
in another window.
Now that you have both of these running, clients are ready to be connected.
At this point, you are ready to try BioPro, BrainBay, or EEGMIR by connecting
to the server running on your localhost at port 8336 by default.  This
system also allows you to save EEG data to a file using the writeedf.exe
command.  You must run writeedf from a command-line, and must provide a
filename such as 
<pre>
writeedf eegdata.edf
</pre>
Similarly, to play back your
data, use the
<pre>
readedf eegdata.edf
</pre>
command instead of starting your
modeegdriver.  In this way, you can review the same data under several
different applications and parameters.  To get a summary of parameters,
enter either of these commands with no parameters.
<H3>Developer Requirements:</H3>
For Windows users, you must install <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW and
MSYS.</a>  The versions that I test with are
<a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe?download">MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe</a>
and <a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.10.exe?download">MSYS-1.0.10.exe</a>.
Once you have these two installed, you can build the executable under windows.
