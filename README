BUILDING
--------

See "doc/devguide.txt".  Briefly:

  aclocal && autoconf && automake -a
  ./configure
  make


RUNNING
-------

For example:

  src/nsd &
  src/modeegdriver &

Now start up a EEG display client to connect to localhost port 8336.
Alternatively, for testing, connect using telnet:

  telnet localhost 8336

For a simple test, type these commands (assuming modeegdriver has
already started up and connected successfully):

  hello
  display
  getheader 0
  watch 0
